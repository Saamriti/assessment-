<h1>Why Repository exists?</h1>
  <p>In this repository we have discussed about two jupyter notebooks and these two jupyter notebook contains scikit-learn notebook and quantum notebook.</p>
  <p>In the first notebook we have performed some operations on dataset using scikit-learn library.</p>
  <p>In the second notebook we have performed Deutsch’s algorithm using qiskit</p>
  <p>Demonstrations of at least three interesting scikit-learn algorithms. You may
choose these yourself, based on what is covered in class or otherwise. Note that the
demonstrations are at your discretion – you may choose to have an overall spread
of examples across the library or pick a particular part that you find interesting.</p>
  <p>Appropriate plots and other visualisations to enhance your notebook for viewers.</p>
  <p>A clear and concise comparison of quantum computing and classical computing.</p>
  <p>An explanation of Deutsch’s algorithm and code simulating it using qiskit.</p>
